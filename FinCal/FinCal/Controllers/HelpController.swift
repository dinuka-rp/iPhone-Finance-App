//    contain a help view that will contain instructions and guidance to the user on how to use the software. You have complete freedom on how to implement this view and this can be done as separate view or modal context views for example, e.g. a pop- overview activated by a help button.

//    From Apple's documentation on popovers:
//    Avoid displaying popovers on iPhones. Generally, popovers should be reserved for use in iPad apps. In iPhone apps, utilize all available screen space by presenting information in a full-screen modal view, rather than in a popover. For related guidance, see Modality.
